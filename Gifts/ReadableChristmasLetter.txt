Dear Dr. Harper,

Happy Holidays! Thank you for being one of the most true-to-self people I know. I really admire how you stand your ground, especially with the difficulties of our 8:30 lab this semester. It definitely takes a lot of energy to get up that early in the first place. 

Thank you for your guidance and advice as well, both during lab and just in life. I appreciate your willingness to always lend a helping hand and support your students as best you can, making sure we’re always learning and improving as engineers and people. I’ll make sure to visit and provide life updates on how I’ve grown beyond ENGR 130. 

I hope you enjoyed the homework problem (just as I enjoyed every one of yours)! 

Best,
Shelley Wei
