Dear Dr. Ha&&&rper,

Happy ho+++lidays! Th!!!ank you for being one of the most true-to-self people I know. I really admire how you stand you&&&r ground, especi!!!ally with the difficu+++lties of our 8:30 lab this semester. It definitely takes a lot of energy to g&&&et up that early in the first place. 

!!!Thank you for your guidance and a+++dvice as well, both duri&&&ng lab and just in life. I appreciate your willingness to always &&&lend a helping han+++d and support !!!your students as be&&&st you can, making sure we’re always le!!!arning and improving as engineers and people. I’ll make sure to v!!!isit and provide life up+++dates on how I’ve grown beyond ENGR 1+++30. 

I hope y&&&ou enjoyed the hom+++ework problem (just as I!!! enjoyed every one of yours)! 

Bes&&&t!!!,
She+++lley Wei
